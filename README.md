# üöÄ Growvy Frontend Project

## ‚úÖ Final Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization

### ‚úîÔ∏è Testing
- **Component testing**: All major components were tested for rendering and responsiveness.
- **Layout inspection**: Used browser dev tools to check element positions and hierarchy.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Used responsive viewports and media queries.

### üêû Debugging
- **Employee icon position issue**: Fixed using `position: absolute`, and `z-index`.
- **Footer alignment bug**: Resolved by moving the footer outside restricted containers and setting `width: 100%`.
- **Text and card overflow**: Adjusted padding/margin inside cards.
- **Star rating vertical alignment**: Scoped `.rating-star` using container-specific classes to avoid global CSS collision.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Removed unnecessary re-renders by simplifying component structure.
- Used optimized image sizes.
- Ensured only required CSS rules were loaded per component.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
